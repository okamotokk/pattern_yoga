In this workspace, there are two directories, pattern and json_form. The directory named json_form is consisted of the directory  named yoga that has yoga form images, seven json files which have skeletant features related to each images and the python files which make json file related to each yoga images. The directory named pattern is consisted of the yoga pose images in the directory named image_data, input videos which are used to infer, output videos, which is infered from input videos, the json files which are same to the files in json_form, feedback images that are used in output videos and two ipynb files. I want to note that the point_data's content is a copy of seven josn files which exisit in json_form directory. Additionally, in the ipynb files, there are some pip install commands. If the command is not sufficient in your environment, please install libraries that is needed to compile and calculate the ipynb file.
